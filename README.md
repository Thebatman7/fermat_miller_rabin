# fermat_miller_rabin
Prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem and the Miller-Rabin condition
For this project we gained experience with algorithms for modular arithmetic (a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus) and randomized algorithms.
The code implements a prime number test based on Fermat's little theorem and the Miller-Rabin conditions.
The Fermat primality test is a probabilistic test to determine whether a number is a probable prime.
The Miller–Rabin primality test or Rabin–Miller primality test is a probabilistic primality test: an algorithm which determines whether a given number is likely to be prime, similar to the Fermat primality test and the Solovay–Strassen primality test.
